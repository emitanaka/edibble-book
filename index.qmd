The book will include about the basics of experimental design and how to get started with the `edibble` R-package and its extensions to plan, design and simulate experiments. 

An experimental design is a huge field, and no doubt I know only a small portion of it. So if you find mistakes or I'm not giving enough due attention or credit to an important concept, please feel to let me know.
