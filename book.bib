  abstract = {Introduction\hspace{0.6em} Increasing urban populations have led to the growth of informal settlements, with contaminated environments linked to poor human health through a range of interlinked pathways. Here, we describe the design and methods for the Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments (RISE) study, a transdisciplinary randomised trial evaluating impacts of an intervention to upgrade urban informal settlements in two Asia-\-Pacific countries. Methods and analysis\hspace{0.6em} RISE is a cluster randomised controlled trial among 12 settlements in Makassar, Indonesia, and 12 in Suva, Fiji. Six settlements in each country have been randomised to receive the intervention at the outset; the remainder will serve as controls and be offered intervention delivery after trial completion. The intervention involves a water-\-sensitive approach, delivering site-s\- pecific, modular, decentralised infrastructure primarily aimed at improving health by decreasing exposure to environmental faecal contamination.},
