# Roles of people involved in the experiment {#people}


An experiment generally involves more than one person. For simplicity, let us suppose there are three actors:

* the **domain expert** who drives the experimental objective and has the intricate knowledge about the subject area,
* the **statistician** who creates the experimental design layout after taking into account statistical and practical constraints, and 
* the **technician** who carries out the experiment and collects the data. 

The actors are purely illustrative and in practice, multiple people can take on each role, one person can take on multiple roles, and a person is not necessary a specialist in the role assigned (e.g. a statistician role can be carried out by a person who's primarily training is not in statistics). All the roles can be acted out by a single individual. Ideally, all parties should have clarity of the final experimental design.
